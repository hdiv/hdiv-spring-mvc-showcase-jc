<p>
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, 
generally in the form of a script, to a different end user. These flaws are quite widespread and occur anywhere 
a web application uses input from a user in the output it generates without validating it.

It is always good practice to sanitize all input data, especially data that will used in OS command, 
scripts, and database queries.</p>
